The Currency Converter is a Java-based console application that allows users to convert amounts from one currency to another using real-time exchange 
rates fetched from the ExchangeRate-API. This application provides a simple interface for users to input the currency they are converting from, the amount,
and the currency they wish to convert to, and it returns the converted amount.
